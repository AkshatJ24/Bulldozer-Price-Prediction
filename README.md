# üöú Bulldozer Price Prediction

This repository contains the code for a machine learning project that predicts the sale price of bulldozers based on their usage, equipment type, and configuration. The solution is developed for the Kaggle competition "[Blue Book for Bulldozers](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers)".

The project uses a Random Forest Regressor and includes a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline to handle the complex, time-series dataset provided.

## üìä Dataset

The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle competition and is not included in this repository due to its size. You can download it directly from the **[competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data)**.

After downloading, you must place the `.csv` files inside a subfolder named `bluebook-for-bulldozers` for the notebook to run correctly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

The project follows a structured machine learning workflow:

1.  **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**:
    * The `saledate` column is parsed to extract temporal features like `saleYear`, `saleMonth`, and `saleDayofweek`.
    * Missing numerical values (e.g., `MachineHoursCurrentMeter`) are imputed using the median of the training data. A binary indicator column (`_is_missing`) is also created to retain the information that a value was originally missing.
    * All object-type columns are converted to pandas `category` types, which are then converted into numerical codes for the model. This process ensures consistent encoding across the training, validation, and test sets.

2.  **Target Transformation**:
    * To optimize for the competition's Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE) metric, the target variable `SalePrice` is transformed using `np.log1p` before training. Predictions are converted back to their original scale using `np.expm1`.

3.  **Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning**:
    * A `RandomForestRegressor` is used as the predictive model.
    * Hyperparameter tuning is performed using `RandomizedSearchCV`.
    * To prevent data leakage in the time-series data, a `TimeSeriesSplit` is used as the cross-validation strategy during tuning.

4.  **Final Model Training**:
    * After identifying the best hyperparameters, the model is retrained on the **combined training and validation datasets** to learn from all available data before making final predictions on the test set.
